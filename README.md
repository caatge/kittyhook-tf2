# kittyhook-tf2

barely functional poc that makes the dedicated server ""compatible"" with the x360 version of tf2

## how does it work

good question!! well, it does not, the most ive been able to get so far is joining scout on the red team (thanks bsp) and walking around the spawn while spectating with a pc copy of tf2

## how to use (please don't)

* get cmake and vs 2022 build tools
* generate the solution and build in Win32
* use v2 version of 441 and 442 with maps from v0 because it doesnt work otherwise idk why
* connect from a devkit (retail doesn't open the socket for Some reason...)

## bugs

* its a miracle this thing works at all
* don't expect much given how hackfucked the entity networking is
